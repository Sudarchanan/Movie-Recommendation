#K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier

This repository contains a simple implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm in Python.

##Files

- `KNearestNeighbours.py`: This is the main Python script that contains the `KNearestNeighbours` class for the KNN classifier.

##Usage

1. Import the `KNearestNeighbours` class from `KNearestNeighbours.py`.
2. Initialize the class with your training data, target values, test point, and the number of neighbours to consider.
3. Call the `fit` method to perform the KNN classification.


##Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- Pillow
- pandas
- requests
- beautifulsoup4
- urllib3
